## Problem

### Bear and Ladder

Bearland has infinitely many cities, numbered starting from 1. Some pairs of cities are connected with bidirectional roads:

- There are roads 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8, and so on (there is a road between cities 2 *i+1 and 2* i+2 for every non-negative integer i).
- There are roads 1-3, 3-5, 5-7, 7-9,... (between every two consecutive odd numbers).
- There are roads 2-4, 4-6, 6-8, 8-10,... (between every two consecutive even numbers).

This is how the first few cities and roads between them look like:

You are given  **Q**  queries. In each query, for the given pair of different cities  **a**  and  **b**, you should check if there is a road between them. For each query, print "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

### Input

The first line of the input contains an integer  **Q**, denoting the number of queries.

Each of the following  **Q**  lines contains two distinct integers  **a**  and  **b**, denoting two cities in one query.

### Output

For each query, output a single line containing the answer — "YES" if there is a road between the given cities  **a**  and  **b**, and "NO" otherwise (without the quotes).

### Constraints
- 1 ≤ Q ≤ 1000
- 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 109
- a ≠ b
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
7
1 4
4 3
5 4
10 12
1 3
999999999 1000000000
17 2384823
```

```
NO
YES
NO
YES
YES
YES
NO
```

### Explanation:

In the example test, the answer is "YES" for pairs (4, 3), (10, 12), (1, 3) and (999999999, 1000000000). Roads 3-4 and 1-3 you can see on the drawing in the statement.

The answer is "NO" for example for a pair (1, 4), because there is no road between cities 1 and 4.

            if (diff == 2 && (a % 2 == b % 2))
            System.out.println("YES");
            else if (diff == 1 && Math.min(a, b) % 2 == 1) 
            System.out.println("YES");
            else 
            System.out.println("NO");
		}
	}
}
