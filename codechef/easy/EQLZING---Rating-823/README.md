## Problem

### Equalizing Numbers

Chef has two integers $A$ and $B$. In one operation he can choose any integer $d,$ and make one of the following two moves :

- Add $d$ to $A$ and subtract $d$ from $B$.
- Add $d$ to $B$ and subtract $d$ from $A$.

Chef is allowed to make as many operations as he wants. Can he make $A$ and $B$  **equal** ?

### Input Format
- First line will contain $T$, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
- Each test case contains of a single line of input, two integers $A, B$.
### Output Format

For each test case, if Chef can make the two numbers equal print `YES` else print `NO`.

You may print each character of the string in uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings `yEs`, `Yes`, `YeS`, and `YES` will all be treated as identical).

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 1000$
- $1 \leq A,B \leq 1000$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
2
3 3
1 2

```

```
Yes
No

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  Since $A$ and $B$ are already equal, Chef does not need any operations.

 **Test case $2$:**  It can be shown that $A$ and $B$ can never be made equal using any number of given operations.

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.lang.*;
import java.io.*;

class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		// your code goes here
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int t = sc.nextInt();
        while (t-- > 0) {
            int A = sc.nextInt();
            int B = sc.nextInt();
            if ((A + B) % 2 == 0)
            System.out.println("YES");
            else
            System.out.println("NO");
        }
	}
}

```
