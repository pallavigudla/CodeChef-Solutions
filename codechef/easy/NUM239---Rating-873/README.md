## Problem

### Counting Pretty Numbers

Vasya likes the number $239$. Therefore, he considers a number  *pretty*  if its last digit is $2$, $3$ or $9$.

Vasya wants to watch the numbers between $L$ and $R$ (both inclusive), so he asked you to determine how many pretty numbers are in this range. Can you help him?

### Input
- The first line of the input contains a single integer $T$ denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- The first and only line of each test case contains two space-separated integers $L$ and $R$.
### Output

For each test case, print a single line containing one integer — the number of pretty numbers between $L$ and $R$.

### Constraints
- $1 \le T \le 100$
- $1 \le L \le R \le 10^5$

Output

```
2
1 10
11 33
```

```
3
8
```

### Explanation:

 **Example case 1:**  The pretty numbers between $1$ and $10$ are $2$, $3$ and $9$.

 **Example case 2:**  The pretty numbers between $11$ and $33$ are $12$, $13$, $19$, $22$, $23$, $29$, $32$ and $33$.

		    int count = 0;
		    for(int i=l;i<=r;i++){
		    int d = i % 10;
		    if(d==2||d==3||d==9){
		        count++;
		       }
		    }
		    System.out.println(count);
		}
