## Problem

### Badminton Serves

Chef is playing badminton today. The service rules of this singles game of badminton are as follows:

- The player who starts the game serves from the right side of their court.
- Whenever a player wins a point, they serve next.
- If the server has won an even number of points during a game, then they will serve from the right side of the service court for the subsequent point.

Chef will be the player who begins the game.

Given the number of points $P$ obtained by Chef at the end of the game, please determine how many times Chef served from the  **right**  side of the court.

Please see the sample cases below for explained examples.

### Input Format
- The first line of input contains a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases. The description of $T$ test cases follows.
- Each test case consists of a single line containing one integer $P$, the points obtained by Chef.
### Output Format

For each test case, output in a single line the number of times Chef served from the  **right**  side of the court.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^3$
- $0 \leq P \leq 10^9$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
2
9
53
746
```

```
2
5
27
374
```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$** : Chef obtained $2$ points at the end of the game. This means he served two times from the right side of the court, once when his score was $0$ and once again when his score was $2$.

 **Test case $2$** : Chef obtained $9$ points at the end of the game. This means he served $5$ times from the right side of the court. The points when he had to serve from right were: $0,2,4,6,8$.
